# Used Car Price Analysis (CarDekho Dataset)

## Introduction

This project uses a dataset from **CarDekho**, one of the largest platforms in India for buying and selling used cars. The goal of this project is to analyze different characteristics of cars and understand how these features affect their selling price. This dataset is suitable for data analysis and machine learning tasks, especially for creating models that predict the price of a used car.

## About the Dataset

The dataset provides detailed information about used cars, including:

-   **Car Name**: The brand and model of the car

-   **Year**: The manufacturing year of the car

-   **Selling Price**: The current market price of the used car

-   **Current Price**: The original price of the car when it was new

-   **Kms**: Total kilometers driven

-   **Fuel Type**: Type of fuel used (e.g., CNG, Diesel, Petrol)

-   **Seller Type**: Whether the seller is an individual or a dealer

-   **Transmission**: Manual or Automatic

-   **Owner**: Number of previous owners

## Objectives

In this project, I aim to:

-   Explore and clean the dataset

-   Identify patterns and trends in used car pricing

-   Understand which factors influence the selling price

-   Build predictive models to estimate car pices

## Expected Outcomes

By the end of this project, I expect to:

-   Gain insights into how car features affect price

-   Create visualizations to better understand the dataset

-   Build a model that predicts the resale price of a car based on its characteristics
